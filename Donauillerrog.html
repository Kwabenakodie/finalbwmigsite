Fluctuations, both positive and negative, are observed across various age groups, indicating changing preferences, opportunities, or external factors influencing migration patterns

It allows them to anticipate and plan for the evolving needs of different age groups, such as ensuring adequate infrastructure, services, and resources are available to support the changing population dynamics. By adapting to these migration patterns, Donau Iller can enhance its attractiveness as a place to live, work, and thrive for individuals of all ages.
