			With infants, the data shows a mixed pattern of migration. There are notable fluctuations in the numbers, indicating inconsistent growth over the years. While some years exhibit significant increases, others display negative changes or minimal growth. This suggests that the migration of infants to Stuttgart has been variable, potentially influenced by factors such as economic conditions, social dynamics, or policy changes affecting family migration patterns.
			Moving on to children, the data reveals a generally positive trend in their migration to Stuttgart. The numbers consistently show increases, indicating a steady inflow of children and their families to the city. The growth in this age group might be driven by factors such as educational opportunities, family-friendly amenities, and Stuttgart's appeal as a place for raising children.
			In the case of teenagers, the data portrays a predominantly negative trend in migration. The numbers consistently exhibit declines, suggesting a decrease in the migration of teenagers to Stuttgart. Various factors could contribute to this trend, including changes in educational options, employment prospects, or preferences among teenagers and their families.
			Considering adult migration, the data shows both positive and negative changes throughout the period. There are years of substantial growth, followed by years of decline or minimal change. This indicates a relatively volatile pattern in the migration of adults to Stuttgart. Economic factors, job opportunities, and the overall attractiveness of the city might influence adult migration patterns.
			Lastly, the data for older adults demonstrates mixed trends in migration. Some years display increases, while others show decreases or modest changes. This suggests a complex pattern in the migration of older individuals to Stuttgart. Factors such as retirement plans, healthcare services, and the city's appeal as a retirement destination may contribute to these fluctuations.
			In summary, the data on migration changes for different age groups in Stuttgart from 2012 to 2021 highlights diverse trends. While children generally exhibit positive growth, infants, teenagers, adults, and older adults experience more varied patterns. These migration trends provide valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and local authorities to understand the dynamics of population change in Stuttgart. By recognizing the shifts in each age group, appropriate measures can be taken to address the evolving needs of the population and ensure the city's resources and services align with the changing demographics.
