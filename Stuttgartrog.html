			Beginning with infants, the data indicates a fluctuating pattern of migration throughout the given period. There are alternating years of positive and negative growth, suggesting a somewhat inconsistent flow of infants migrating to Stuttgart. However, overall, the numbers show a modest increase, indicating a consistent but varying influx of young children and their families.
			Moving on to children, the data reveals a generally positive growth trend in their migration to Stuttgart. The numbers show a steady increase with some minor fluctuations. This suggests a consistent inflow of families with school-age children to the city. The growth in this age group may be influenced by factors such as educational opportunities, family-friendly amenities, and the appeal of Stuttgart as a place to raise children.
			In the case of teenagers, the data displays a predominantly negative growth trend over the given period. The numbers indicate a decrease in the migration of teenagers to Stuttgart. This decline might be attributed to various factors, including changes in demographics, educational opportunities, or preferences among teenagers and their families.
			Considering adult migration, the data indicates a modest and relatively stable growth pattern. The numbers show a slight increase in the migration of adults to Stuttgart, with minimal year-to-year variations. This trend could be influenced by factors such as employment opportunities, economic stability, and the city's reputation as a center for business and culture.
			Lastly, the data for older adults demonstrates a generally positive growth trend in their migration to Stuttgart. The numbers consistently show an upward trajectory, indicating an increasing number of older individuals relocating to the city. This growth may be driven by factors such as retirement plans, healthcare services, and Stuttgart's appeal as a city that offers a high quality of life for seniors
			In summary, the data on migration patterns for different age groups in Stuttgart from 2012 to 2021 highlights distinct trends. While the migration of infants and children demonstrates relatively positive growth, teenagers experience a decline in migration. Adult migration shows modest growth, while the migration of older adults displays a consistent increase.
			These migration patterns offer valuable insights for understanding the demographic changes occurring in Stuttgart. They provide a basis for urban planners, policymakers, and local authorities to anticipate and address the evolving needs of the population. By recognizing the trends in each age group, appropriate measures can be taken to ensure the city's infrastructure, services, and resources align with the changing dynamics and support the well-being of its residents across all age ranges.
