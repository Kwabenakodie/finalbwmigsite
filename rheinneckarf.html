			The forecasted population for Rhein Neckar from 2022 to 2040 presents an interesting mix of trends and changes across different age groups. 
			Starting with infants, the population remains relatively stable over the forecast period. With an initial count of 1,381 in 2022, the number gradually increases to 1,590 by 2040. 
			Moving on to children, we observe a more dynamic pattern. The population of children shows consistent growth, starting at 21,017 in 2022 and gradually climbing to 47,297 by 2040. 
			In contrast to children, the number of teenagers fluctuates slightly over the years. With a peak of 6,802 in 2026, the teenage population experiences periods of slight increase and decrease. However, it will tend to stabilize around 6,500 in the later years of the forecast.
			Shifting our focus to the adult population, we find a relatively stable scenario. With an initial count of 150,806 in 2022, the number shows minor fluctuations but remains around 151,900 from 2027 onwards. This suggests that the adult population experiences limited changes due to factors such as stable birth rates, migration patterns, and life expectancy.
			Finally, the population of older adults exhibits steady growth. Starting at 18,916 in 2022, the number steadily increases to 20,619 by 2040. This trend can be attributed to factors such as advances in healthcare, increased life expectancy, and the aging of the overall population.
			In summary, the forecasted population of Rhein Neckar showcases a diverse range of trends across different age groups. While the number of infants remains relatively stable, children and older adults show significant growth. Teenagers will experience some fluctuations, and the adult population remains relatively constant.
